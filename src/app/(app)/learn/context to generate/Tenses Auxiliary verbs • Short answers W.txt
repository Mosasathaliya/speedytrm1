10 Unit 1 It's a wonderful world!
WONDERS OFI don't believe that today's wonders are similar in
kind to the wonders of the Ancient World. They were
all buildings, such as the Pyramids in Egypt, or other
architectural structures. Over the past 10o years,
we have seen amazing technological and scientific
achievements. These are surely our modern wonders.
1
It is everywhere. More than half a billion people use it, and the number
of people who are online increases by 100 million every year. In 1994
there were only a few hundred web pages. Today there are billions.
It has revolutionized the way we live and work. But we are still in the
early days. Soon there will be more and more interactivity between the
user and the website, and we will be able to give instructions using speech.
2
In 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped out of his space capsule onto the
surface of the moon and made his famous statement: 'That's one small
step for a man, one giant leap for mankind'. Since then, there have been
space probes to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and even to the sun. One day, a
space observatory will study how the first stars and galaxies began.
So far, it seems that we are alone in the universe. There are no signs
yet that there is intelligent life outside our own solar system. But who
knows what the future holds?

HE MODERN WORLD by
Ann
Halliday
3
Surely nothing has done more for the comfort and
happiness of the human race than the advances in health
care! How many millions of people have benefited from
the humble aspirin? How many lives has penicillin saved?
Average life expectancy worldwide has risen dramatically
over the past 100 years, from about 47 years in 1900 to
about 77 years today.
4
We are a world on the move. Airlines carry more than 1.5
billion people to their destinations every year. It is estimated
that, at any one time these days, there are as many people
travelling in aeroplanes as the total number of people who
travelled abroad in the whole of the nineteenth century (but I
have no idea how they worked this out!).
5
It is true that they are now commercialized, and there is
greed and drug abuse. However, it is a competition in which
almost every country in the world takes part. Every four years,
for a brief moment, we see the world come together in peace
and friendship. We feel hope again for the future of mankind.
6
In 1724, Jonathan Swift wrote, 'Whoever makes two blades
of grass or two ears of corn grow where only one grew before
serves mankind better than the whole race of politicians'.
In Europe our farmers have done this. In 1709,
whole villages in France died of hunger. Now
in Europe, we can't eat all the food we produce.
If only politicians could find a way to share
it with those parts of the world where
there is famine.
7 We are still here!
The last wonder of the modern
world is simply that we are still here.
We have had nuclear weapons for
over 50 years that could destroy
the world, but we haven't used
them to do it. This is surely
the greatest wonder
of all.

THE CLOWN
DOCTOR
All over the world, children in hospital are being
treated with a new kind of medicine: laughter.
LUCY is 23 and works for Theodora Children's
Trust. She is one of many clown doctors who
bring a smile to the faces of sick children.
I'm a Theodora clown doctor, I call myself
Dr LooLoo. I spend two days a week in
children's hospitals being extremely silly with
my friend and colleague Dr Chequers. We make funny
faces, tell jokes, and do magic tricks. As I walk into the
wards I blow bubbles, shake hands with the kids, and
make up nonsense songs for those children well
enough to sing. We take special balloons to make
'balloon animals' and tell funny stories about them.
We often meet kids who one week look really sick,
then we go back the next week and they're racing
about yelling 'Hi there, Dr LooLoo! Hi Dr Chequers!
I'm naturally a very cheerful person. I've always
been a clown. In fact my father's a clown and I started
working with him when I was eight years old. I knew it
was just the job for me and I became a clown doctor
because I think it's a great way to cheer up sick,
frightened children in hospital. I wear a fancy coat,
a yellow shirt, and tights with big stripes. Also, I have
a red rubber nose and wear my hair in crazy plaits.
Being a clown in a hospital is very tiring both
physically and emotionally. We have to learn not to
show our feelings, otherwise we'd be useless. Clown
doctors are sensitive but this is not a side most people
see. To the children we're happy all the time. I'm still
learning to allow myself to feel sad occasionally.
There are special kids you get really close to. At the
moment I'm working
with a very sick little
girl from Bosnia who
speaks no English,
so our only common
language is laughter.
She's been in and
out of hospital for
operations so many
times and she's always
on my mind.

At lunchtime we eat in the hospital cafeteria and that's
really useful because we meet the nurses and doctors.
They tell us about particular kids who they think will
benefit from a clown doctor visit. If a child is
frightened, perhaps they're being given an injection or
some nasty medicine - we can distract them so the
nurses can do their job.
About six o'clock Dr Chequers and I take off our
make-up and change our clothes. We're totally
exhausted. Sometimes I have a night out with friends,
it helps me unwind. When I finally fall into bed,
I crash out. At weekends we are often asked to
participate in events to raise money for Theodora
Children's Trust. It's a charity; so we are paid with
the money people give. Being a clown doctor
makes the worries of everyday life seem small.

PABLOPICASSO
The painter
HIS EARLY LIFE
On 25 October, 1881, a baby boy
was born in Málaga, Spain. It was a
difficult birth and to help him
breathe, cigar smoke was blown
into his nose! This baby grew up to
be one of the twentieth century's
greatest painters - PABLO PICASSO.
Picasso showed his genius from a
very young age. His first word was
lápiz (Spanish for pencil) and he
could draw before he could talk. He
was the only son in the family, so he
was thoroughly spoiled. He hated
school and often refused to go unless
he was allowed to take one of his
father's pet pigeons with him!
Apart from pigeons, his great love
was art. When in 1891 his father got
a job as an art teacher, Pablo went
with him to work and watched him
paint. Sometimes he was allowed to
help. One evening, his father was
painting a picture of their pigeons
when he had to leave the room.
When he returned, Pablo had
completed the picture. It was so
beautiful and lifelike that he gave
his son his palette and brushes and
never painted again. Pablo was just
thirteen.
HIS LIFE AS AN ARTIST
His genius as an artist was soon
recognized by many people, but
others were shocked by his strange
and powerful paintings. He is
probably best known for his Cubist
pictures. His portraits of people
were often made up of triangles and
squares with their features in the
wrong places. One of his most famous
portraits was of the American writer
Gertrude Stein, who he met after
he'd moved to Paris in 1904.
His work changed ideas about art
around the world, and to millions
of people, modern art means the
work of Picasso. Guernica [below],
which he painted in 1937, records
the bombing of that small Basque
town during the Spanish Civil War,
and is undoubtedly one of the
masterpieces of modern painting.
HIS FINAL YEARS
Picasso married twice and also had
many mistresses. He had four
children. The last, Paloma, was born
in 1949 when he was 68 years old.
At the age of 90 he was honoured
by an exhibition in the Louvre in
Paris. He was the first living artist
to be shown there.
Picasso created over 6,000 paintings,
drawings, and sculptures. Today, a
Picasso costs millions of pounds.
Once, when the French Minister of
Culture was visiting Picasso, the
artist accidentally spilled some
paint on the Minister's trousers.
Picasso apologized and wanted to
pay for them to be cleaned, but the
Minister said, 'Non! Please, Monsieur
Picasso, just sign my trousers!"
Picasso died of heart failure during
an attack of influenza in 1973.

Guernicа
ERNESTHEMINGWAY
The writer
HIS EARLY LIFE
ERNEST HEMINGWAY was one of
the great American writers of the
twentieth century. He was born on
21 July 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois,
the second of six children. His
family was strict and very religious.
His father taught his children a love
of nature and the outdoor life.
Ernest caught his first fish at the
age of three, and was given a
shotgun for his twelfth birthday.
His mother taught him a love of
music and art. At school, he was
good at English and wrote for the
school newspaper. He graduated in
1917, but he didn't go to college. Hе
went to Kansas City and worked as
a journalist for the Star newspaper.
He learned a lot, but left after only
six months to go to war.
ERNEST
HEMINGWAY
ER!
HEMI
HEMINGWAY AND WAR
Hemingway was fascinated by war.
He had wanted to become a soldier,
but couldn't because he had poor
eyesight. Instead, in the First World
War, he became an ambulance
driver and was sent to Italy, where
he was wounded in 1918. After the
war, he went to live in Paris, where
he was encouraged in his work by
the American writer Gertrude Stein.
In the 1930s, he became a war
correspondent in the Spanish Civil
War and World War II. Many of his
books were about war. His most
successful book, For Whom the Bell
Tolls, was written in 1940 and is
about the Spanish Civil War. Another
novel, A Farewell to Arms, is about
the futility of war.
HIS PERSONAL LIFE
Hemingway's success in writing
was not mirrored by similar success
in his personal life. He married four
times. His first wife divorced him in
1927. He immediately married again
and moved to Key West, Florida,
where he enjoyed hunting, fishing,
and drinking, but he also suffered
from depression. This wasn't helped
when, in 1928, his father committed
suicide. Hemingway's health was not
good and he had many accidents.
Two more marriages failed and
he began to drink heavily. In 1954,
he survived two plane crashes.
In October of the same year he
was awarded the Nobel Prize for
literature, but he was too ill to receive
it in person.
HIS FINAL YEARS
His final years were taken up with
health problems and alcohol. He
began to lose his memory and
he couldn't write any more.
On Sunday, 2 July 1961,
For Whom the Bell Tolls Hemingway killed himself with a shotgun, just as
his father had done
before him.

A WORLD GUIDE TO
Good Manners
How not to behave badly abroad
by Norman Ramshaw
Travelling to all corners of the world gets easier and easier. We live in a
global village, but this doesn't mean that we all behave in the same way.
• Greetings
How should you behave when you meet
someone for the first time? An American
or Canadian shakes your hand firmly
while looking you straight in the eyes. In
many parts of Asia, there is no physical
contact at all. In Japan, you should bow,
and the more respect you want to show,
(1). In Thailand, the greeting is made
by pressing both hands together at the
chest, as if you are praying, and bowing
your head slightly. In both countries, eye
contact is avoided as a sign of respect.
이Clothes
Many countries have rules about what
you should and shouldn't wear. In Asian
and Muslim countries, you shouldn't
reveal the body, especially women,
who (2).
In Japan, you should take off your shoes
when entering a house or a restaurant.
Remember to place them neatly
together facing the door you came in.
This is also true in China, Korea,
Thailand, and Iran.
• Food and drink
In Italy, Spain, and Latin America, lunch
is often the biggest meal of the day, and
can last two or three hours. For this
reason many people eat a light breakfast
and a late dinner. In Britain, you might
have a business lunch and do business as
you eat. In Mexico and Japan, (3)
Lunch is a time to relax and socialize,
and the Japanese rarely drink alcohol
at lunchtime. In Britain and the United
States, it's not unusual to have a
business meeting over breakfast, and
in China it's common to have business
banquets, but you shouldn't discuss
business during the meal.
Doing business
In most countries, an exchange of
business cards is essential for all
introductions. You should include your
company name and your position. If
you are going to a country where your
language is not widely spoken, you
can get the reverse side of your card
printed in the local language. In Japan,
you must present your card with both
hands, with the writing facing the
person you are giving it to.
In many countries, business hours
are from 9.00 or 10.00 to 5.00 or 6.00.
However in some countries, such as
Greece, Italy, and Spain, (4) then
remain open until the evening.
Japanese business people consider it
their professional duty to go out after
work with colleagues to restaurants,
bars, or nightclubs. If you are invited,
you shouldn't refuse, even if you don't
feel like staying out late.
EXTRA TIPS
HERE ARE SOME EXTRA TIPS
BEFORE YOU TRAVEL:
1 In many Asian cultures, it is
acceptable to smack your lips
when you eat. It means that the
food is good.
2 In France, you shouldn't sit down
in a café until you've shaken
hands with everyone you know.
3 In India and the Middle East,
you must never use the left hand
(5).
4 In China, your host will keep
refilling your dish unless you lay
your chopsticks across your bowl.
5 Most South Americans and
Mexicans like to stand very close
to the person they're talking to.
You shouldn't back away.
6
7
In Russia, you must match your
hosts drink for drink or they will
think you unfriendly.
In Ireland, social events
sometimes end with singing
and dancing. You may be asked
to sing.
8 In America, you should eat
your hamburger with both hands
and as quickly as possible.
You shouldn't try to have a
conversation until it is eaten.

My kind of holiday
She travels for her job, but when it's her own
holiday, Karen Saunders stays at home.
Karen Saunders has her own travel agency in Mayfair, London
that sends people all over the world on their dream holidays.
She needs to know where she's sending them, so she goes on
working holidays four or five times a year.
My ideal holiday
My ideal holiday has a little bit of
everything. I like lazing on a beach
with a pile of books, but then I get bored and
I need to do something. I love exploring new
places, especially on foot, and nosing around in
churches, shops, museums, and restaurants.
I'm very into cooking, so I love going around
markets and food stores.
However, I must confess that my favourite
'holiday resort' is home. I travel so much in
my job that just waking up in my own bed is
heaven. I potter around the house in my
pyjamas, read the paper, do some gardening,
shop for some food, then make a delicious
meal in the evening.
My business holidays
I have three trips coming up. I'm looking
forward to going to Canada soon, where I'm
staying for four nights at the Ice Hotel. This
is a giant igloo situated in Montmorency Fall
Park, just 20 minutes from downtown Quebec.
It is made from 4,500 tons of snow and 250
tons of ice, and it takes 5 weeks to build.
It will stay open for three months. When the
spring arrives, it will melt. Then it will be built
again for next year - maybe in a different place!
Each room is supplied with a sleeping bag
made from deer skins. The hotel has two art
galleries featuring ice sculptures, and an ice
cinema. It also has a bar where all the drinks
come in glasses made of ice. Of course I'll
visit them all!
In complete contrast to the Ice Hotel, I'm
going to Dubai the following month, to stay
a few days at the spectacular Burj al-Arab,
which means the Arabian Tower. It's shaped
like a giant sail, and it rises dramatically out
of the Arabian Gulf. Each room has sea views.
I really want to try the restaurant in the tube at
the top next to the helipad. Other must-dos
include shopping in the markets, called souks.
(You can buy designer clothes, perfumes, and
spices, but what I want is some gold jewellery.)
I'm also going to visit the camel races.
The next trip, different again, is to Baobab
Rivers, in Selous, Tanzania, for a seven-day safari
and I'm looking forward to a fors1

GL BAL PIZZA
BY CONNIE ODONE
So you thought the hamburger was the world's most popular fast food? After all, McDonald's
Golden Arches span the globe. But no, there is another truly universal fast food, the ultimate
fast food. It's easy to make, easy to serve, much more varied than the hamburger, can be
eaten with the hands, and it's delivered to your front door or served in fancy restaurants.
It's been one of America's favourite foods for over 50 years. It is, of course, the pizza.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF PIZZA
It's kind of silly to talk about the moment when pizza
was 'invented'. It gradually evolved over the years, but
one thing's for certain - it's been around for a very long
time. The idea of using pieces of flat, round bread as
plates came from the Greeks. They called them
'plakuntos' and ate them with various simple toppings
such as oil, garlic, onions, and herbs. The Romans
enjoyed eating something similar and called it 'picea'.
By about 1000 A.D. in the city of Naples, 'picea' had
become 'pizza' and people were experimenting with
more toppings: cheese, ham, anchovies, and finally the
tomato, brought to Italy from Mexico and Peru in the
sixteenth century. Naples became the pizza capital of
the world. In 1889, King Umberto I and
Queen Margherita heard about pizza
and asked to try it. They invited
pizza maker, Raffaele Esposito,
to make it for them. He
decided to make the
pizza like the Italian
flag, so he used red tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese,
and green basil leaves. The Queen loved it and the new
pizza was named 'Pizza Margherita' in her honour.
Pizza migrated to America with the Italians at the
end of the nineteenth century. The first pizzeria in
the United States was opened in 1905 at 531½ Spring
Street, New York City, by Gennaro Lombardi. But the
popularity of pizza really exploded when American
soldiers returned from Italy after World War II and
raved about 'that great Italian dish'. Americans are
now the greatest producers and consumers of pizza
in the world.
PIZZAVIA
1 Americans eat 350 slices of pizza per second.
2 There are 61,269 pizzerias in the United States.
3 Pizza is a $30 billion per year industry.
4 October is national pizza month in the United States.
5 The world's first pizzeria, the Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba,
which opened in Naples in 1830, is still there.
6 Pizza Hut has over 12,000 restaurants and takeaway
outlets in over 90 countries.
7 In America, pepperoni is the favourite topping.
Anchovies is the least favourite.
8 In Japan, eel and squid are favourites.
In Russia it's red herring, salmon, and onions.
9 In Brazil, they like green peas on their pizza.
In Australia the favourites are shrimp and
pineapple.
10 The French love bacon and crème
fraîche on theirs. The English love tuna
and sweetcorn.

The Hurcane HunterThere's no such thing as
an average day in my job!?
Stanley Karras works as a meteorologist
in Tampa, Florida. It's his job to follow
hurricanes by plane and provide information
about them to scientists.
How did you get the job? I was working for the
National Meteorological Office in Bracknell, near
London, in the autumn of 1995, and I saw a
documentary with my family called Stormchasers. It
was about hurricane hunters and I thought, 'Wow,
that's an interesting job!' As it happened, two months
later I came across an ad for a meteorologist to work
in Florida with the same people who had made the
documentary. I applied, was interviewed over the
phone, moved to the US, and started work here in
Tampa in May 1996.
What do you like most about it? I love the travel.
I've been all over the world chasing hurricanes. It's
exciting to end up in different cities and different
countries day after day. If you're a meteorologist,
you have to love flying. I also love working with top
scientists. I've learned so much from them. For me,
it's like a classroom in the sky.
What's an average day like? There's no such thing
as an average day in my job! It all depends on the
weather, and you can't control that. We often take
off at a moment's notice to chase storms. I'm the
one who decides whether we fly low through a
storm. I don't want to take us into a hurricane
that could be particularly nasty.
Have you made any sacrifices to do this job? Yes, one big
one. I'm away from my family. They all live in the UK.
My wife's with me, of course, but her family is also
in the UK, so we're pretty cut off from all of them.
What would you like to do next? I'd like to join a space
programme and be the first meteorologist in space,
but I haven't come up with an experiment to do in
space yet. There aren't any hurricanes!
What advice would you give to someone who wanted to
do your job? Study maths and science and get a
degree in meteorology. I've taken the hurricane
hunter path, but you could be a weather forecaster
or do research. It's a fascinating subject and the
pay's pretty good.
The Trapeze Artist
You only live once so
why stay in a boring job?"
Linda Spelman was a lawyer who found a new
career in a circus. She now works as a trapeze
artist, travelling with circuses throughout Canada,
Europe, and East Asia.
How did you get the job? That's quite a long story.
My father's a lawyer, so I thought I'd become one, too.
Studying law was really, really hard work, so I took up
gymnastics in the evenings to help me relax. When
I finally passed my exams, I thought, 'I need a break.
I want to travel and learn a language.' I'd heard of the
École Nationale du Cirque in Montreal, so I thought,
'I'll join the circus.' I went to Canada and did a trapeze
course and, amazingly, I was good at it.
What do you like most about it? The excitement and the
travel. I always wanted to travel and learn languages and
I've done all of that. Also, I get on really well with circus
people. They're all nationalities. I've learned so much
about life from them.
What's an average day like? Everyone has to help in the
circus, so you begin the day in a new town handing out
flyers. In the afternoon, you work in the box office and
rehearse. Then you do the act in the evening. At the end
of a week, I'm so tired I spend a day in bed. Last month
I twisted my shoulder and couldn't work for a week.
Have you made any sacrifices to do this job? No, I haven't,
not really. I gave up doing something that I hated and
I'm doing something that I love. I do miss my family
sometimes, but that's all. And of course I earn a lot less
than a lawyer.
What would you like to do next? I'm 34 now. I'd like to
carry on doing this until I'm at least 50. There are
Russian trapeze artists still going strong in their fifties.
What advice would you give to someone who wanted to do
your job? You need to be fit and strong and have a good
head for heights. But generally, I'd say to anyone with a
dream, 'Go for it! You only live once, so why stay in a
boring jobЬ?"
The Cowboy
in the sky
Many of today's ironworkers are descendants of the men who
built New York's first skyscrapers.
Michael Doyle is an ironworker in New York City.
He's one of 100 or so ironworkers currently
erecting the steel frame of a new 40-storey
building in Times Square. These ironworkers are
known as 'cowboys in the sky'.
How did you get the job? Ironwork is a trade that is still
handed down from father to son. Many of today's
ironworkers are descendants of the men who built New
York's first skyscrapers. My great-grandfather came over
from Ireland in 1930 to work on the construction of the
Empire State Building. My father and grandfather were
also ironworkers.
What do you like most about it? To me, ironworkers are
the kings of construction. We make the skeleton that the
other workers build on. We have real pride in our work -
you look at the New York skyline and think 'I helped
build that.' Also, we work hard, we play hard. We get on
well together. We ironworkers depend on each other for
our lives. Oh, and the pay is good!
What's an average day like? You never stop in this job.
Eight hours a day, from seven in the morning until three
in the afternoon. You're moving all the time. The crane
lifts the iron girders and you have to move them into
place. There's always danger. It's a fact of life for us.
Have you made any sacrifices to do this job? Yes, one big
one - physical health. The wear and tear to the body is
enormous. I've fallen three times. My father fell two
storeys, lost a finger, and broke his ankles.
What would you like to do next? I'd like to work on
something really important like my great-grandfather
did. Or like my father did, who helped build the World
Trade Center. It's weird - he helped build it and I helped
take it away.
What advice would you give to someone who wanted to do
your job? You need to be strong, really strong. You have
to be OK with height. It usually takes about a year to get
used to it. You can't work and hold on with one hand all
the time. Many guys try it once, then back off and say, 'This is not for me.'

dramatically change it all and smash the jigsaw.

For some people, the easiest thing is to get rid of the money (7) .
Jim Taylor, a sailor from Scotland, won £2 million, and blew the
money in 77 days. He withdrew thousands of pounds a day from the
bank and handed it to former shipmates and strangers in the street. On
one occasion, he handed out £150,000 to homeless people in a Glasgow
park. Later he said he had no regrets about his wasted fortune.
Anita Cotton was the biggest lottery winner at the time when she won
£12 million. It has taken her years to get used to the changes in her life.
'I couldn't have done it without my family,' she says. 'There were so
many lies about me in the press. They said I had dumped my husband

to him. He doesn't seem to notice how you feel.
I know he's worried about his mother, but it's unfair
that he's always at her house and leaves you to do
all the housework. You have a tiring and stressful
job, caring for sick people all day. Make him
understand this and ask him about the hundreds of
lottery tickets you found. Encourage him to look for
work - he'd feel better about himself if he had a job
and it would help the family finances. In the
meantime, don't hide your feelings; otherwise your
anger and resentment will grow.
Yours, Cusia

FAMILY
MATTERS
Oliver Darrow, actor, talks about
his daughter, Carmen.
My first wife and I only
had one child. It might
have been nice to have more.
I would have liked a son, but
we just had Carmen.
I see her as my best friend.
I think she always comes to
me first if she has a problem.
We have the same sense of
humour and share many
interests, except that she's
crazy about animals, obsessed
with them - she has always
had dogs, cats, and horses in
her life.
We were closest when she
was about four, which I think
is a wonderful age for a child.
That's when they need their
parents most. But as soon as Carmen went to school, she seemed
to grow up and grow apart from her family, and any father finds it
difficult with a teenage daughter. She was very moody and had an
odd group of friends. There was an endless stream of strange young
men coming to our house. I remember I once got annoyed with her
in front of her friends and she didn't talk to me for days.
I've always wanted the best for her. We sent her to a good school,
but she wasn't happy there. She left because she wanted to become
an actress, so with my connections I got her into drama school, but
she didn't like that either. She worked for a while doing small roles
'I see her as
my best friend.
in films, but she must have found
it boring because she gave it up,
though she never really said why.
She got married a few years ago;
her husband's a vet. They must
be happy because they work together, and she loves animals.
We have the same tastes in books and music. When she was younger,
I used to take her to the opera - that's my passion - but she can't
have liked it very much because she hasn't come with me for years.
I don't think she goes to the cinema or watches TV much. She might
watch my films, but I don't know. It's not the kind of thing she talks
to me about.
I'm very pleased to have Carmen. She's a good daughter, but I don't
think she likes my new wife very much because she doesn't visit us
very often. I'm looking forward to being a grandfather one day.
I hope she'll have a son.
TWO POINTS OF VIEW ON
A FAMILY RELATIONSHIP
Carmen Darrow, veterinary
assistant, talks about her father, Oliver.
A
I don't really know my father. He isn't easy to get on with. I've
always found him difficult to talk to. He's a bit reserved, but he
loves to be recognized and asked for his autograph.
I think people see his films and think he's very easygoing, but he
really isn't. He's won some awards for his films, and he's really
proud of them. He used to show them to
my friends when they came to the house He's like and that really embarrassed me.
He can't have been home much when
was a small child because I don't remember

much about him. His work always came first, and he was often away
from home making films. I wasn't surprised when he and my mother
split up.
He must have wanted the best for me, but the best was always what
he wanted. He chose my school and I hated it. I had no friends there,
I was miserable and didn't do well, so I was
asked to leave. He must have been very
disappointed, but he said nothing to me. Hе
wanted me to be an actor like him but I'm
not at all like him. I tried it for a while, but I
was miserable until I met my husband. He's
a vet and I'm his assistant. Now I'm doing
what I always wanted to do, working with
animals.
My father and I have always been so
different. I love animals and he loves books
and music, and above all opera, which I
hate. If he comes to see us (we live on a
farm), he always wears totally the wrong
clothes, but we still don't see much of each
other. It's because he didn't really want me
to marry George. He wanted me to marry a
famous film star or something, but of course
I didn't. George and I don't want children,
we have our animals, but my father would
love to have a grandson. Maybe his new
wife will give him the son he wants, but
probably not. She cares too much about
being slim and beautiful.
I occasionally see one of his films on TV.
I find it hard to believe he's my father.
He's like a stranger.

Dad bans phone after

A
Manchester teenager has received a phone
bill for over £450 after sending 3,500 text
messages in just one month.
Tony Russell has had his new 'state of the art'
mobile phone for only three months, but now his
father, Lionel, has taken it away.
'He's been asking me for a mobile for years because
all his friends have got one,' explained Lionel. 'I finally
bought one for his birthday because he's been doing
so well at school, but he and his mates are "textingcrazy". They do it all the time - on buses, in the street.
They even text each other from different sides of the
school playground. They've got "textitis"."
Tony said 'I thought texting was much cheaper than
phoning, so I've been texting my friends all day long
and even into the early hours of the morning. I've
been going to bed at 2.00 most nights. Sometimes my
hand hurt from pressing the buttons so much, but I
was having such good fun that I couldn't bear to stoр!"
His father said, 'I have forgiven him, but I am angry
with the phone company as they are encouraging this
craze.' He has made his son promise to pay back the
money, so Tony has been working on Saturdays. He
has found a job in a shoe shop. So far he has paid
back £46. 'I reckon it will take me about a year to
clear this debt,' he said.

5 Here are the answers to some questions about Dennis. Write the questions.
Famfor notyou go to Hollywood and If look around the trendy
coffee shops and restaurants,
it is unlikely that you will meet
your favourite film star. However,
it is almost certain that you will
meet Dennis Woodruff.
Dennis is a 'movie' star - well, sort
of. You learn this quickly because
he tells everyone he meets. Hе
wears a T-shirt that says 'Dennis
Woodruff, world-famous actor'. On
his modified Chevrolet convertible
he has five Oscars® (fake,
unfortunately) and other awards
that he has won. He also hands out
videotapes of his films in exchange
for a modest $10.
If fame is a matter of being known
by influential people, then Dennis Woodruff is certainly famous. He
describes himself as Hollywood's
best known out-of-work actor. He
has been looking for work for 25
years. It is true that he has been
on television over 300 times and
has worked in about 45 motion
pictures, invariably as an extra.

sort of
But mostly he is known as the
hippie guy with the long blond
ponytail, who is trapped in the
only role he has been able to
play with any success - playing
Dennis. Everything about Dennis
has to do with selling himself.
He talks constantly about his life,
his talent, his artistic abilities,
his ambitions. His never-ending
search for work in the film
industry no longer has any
realistic chance of success, so
now he acts out the role of an
actor looking for work. 'Cast me!'
shouts the writing on his car.
'Buy my movie!'
'Actually,' says Dennis, 'I am a
movie star. It's just that no one
has realized it yet.' His 'movies',
titled Dennis Woodruff the Movie,
Parts I and II and Double Feature,
starring Dennis Woodruff are
heavily autobiographical - more
documentaries of his life than
anything else. You can watch
him auditioning for parts in
front of the security cameras at
local restaurants. People
recognize him and then, sadly,
ignore him.
He has rugged, unconventional
good looks, though he seems
tired. 'I've been making another
movie about me. It's called Life Is
Art. I want to show everyone how
my life is like a work of art.'
One of the most miserable tales
he tells is about how he nearly
made the big time. The famous
actor John Wayne was going to
give him a break, but
unfortunately he died. Legendary
producer Otto Preminger wanted
to make him a star. He also died.
Now nearly 50, Dennis first had
the idea of promoting himself
over 20 years ago when he
asked a casting director why he
had been turned down for a part.
'Because you're not a big name
in Hollywood,' came the answer.
Dennis immediately wrote his
name in huge letters on the top
of his car. It didn't get him any
work, but it did get him noticed.
He's been living in a mobile
home in East Hollywood for 30
years, and to his credit, he
manages to earn a living. He has
set up a production company
with his brother, and he has sold
15,000 copies of his video. True
success, he feels, is just around
the corner. Now there's
optimism for
you.

1 Where is the oldest one in the world?
How well do1 Do animals have feelings?
A All pet owners would say 'Yes'. Molly the dog and Whiskers
the cat can feel angry, depressed, neglected, happy, even
jealous and guilty.
Many scientists, however, are sceptical about
giving animals the full range of emotions
that humans can feel. Part of the problem
is that it is impossible to prove that even
a human being is feeling happy or sad. In
fact, it is only because we can observe
body language and facial expression that
we can deduce it. And of course humans
can express the emotion with language.
However, most researchers do agree
that many creatures experience fear.
Some scientists define this as a primary
emotion.☐

California are home to our

The oldest tree in the
world, Methuselah, has

30What man-made things on
Earth can be seen from space?
visible
'When humans first flew in space, they were amazed to
discover that the only man-made object
from orbit was the Great Wall of
China.' Although this is a nice idea,
it's not true. The Great Wall is
mostly grey stone in a grey
landscape and, in fact, is very
difficult to see even from a
plane flying at a mere 15
kilometres above. What can be
seen when orbiting the Earth
(from about 200 kilometres up)
are the lights of the world's
large metropolitan areas. ☐
90 Unit 11 Tell me about it!

You ask ... we answer!
40 What is the most terrible
natural disaster to have hit
the Earth?
A Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and hurricanes are
responsible for the deaths of thousands of people
every year.
One of the most violent
earthquakes ever recorded
was in Ecuador in 1906.
It was the equivalent of
100 H-bombs, but it was
nothing compared to а
volcanic eruption in
Tambora, Indonesia in
1815. This was the
equivalent of 10,000
H-bombs. But, even these
are nothing compared to
many tropical hurricanes:
they regularly have the energy
of an amazing 100,000 H-bombs.
However, there is one natural disaster that beats all of
these by a very long way - a meteor that hit the Earth
65 million years ago and caused an explosion the
equivalent of 10 million H-bombs. ☐
50 Why isn't there a row 13
on aeroplanes?
A In many countries, the number 13 is considered to be
very unlucky. In France, there is never a house with
the number 13. In the United States, modern high-rise
buildings label the floor that follows 12 as 14.
Where did this fear of a number
come from? The idea goes back
at least to Norse mythology
in ancient times. There
was a banquet with 12
gods. Loki, the spirit of
evil, decided to join
without being
invited. In the fight
that followed,
Balder, the favourite
of the gods, was
killed.
In Christianity, this
theme was repeated
at the Last Supper.
Jesus Christ and his
apostles numbered 13
people at the table. ☐
6 Why do women live longer than men?
A
Women generally live about six years longer than
men. Evidence suggests that boys are the weaker sex
at birth, which means that more die in infancy. Men
also have a greater risk of heart disease than women,
and they have heart attacks earlier in life. Men smoke
and drink more than women, and their
behaviour is generally more
aggressive, particularly when
driving, so they are more
likely to die in accidents.
Also, men are more
often in dangerous
occupations, such as
construction work.
Historically, women
died in childbirth
and men in wars.
So nuns and
philosophers often
lived to great ages.
Now childbearing is
less risky and there
are fewer wars.☐
70 Was Uncle Sam a
real person?
A Yes, he was! This symbol of the United States with a
long white beard, wearing striped trousers and top
hat, was a meat packer from New York state.
I WANT YOU FOR U.S.ARMY
NEAREST RECRUITING STATION
Uncle Sam was Samuel Wilson,
born in Arlington, Massachusetts in
1766. At the age of eight, he was a
drummer boy in the American
Revolution. Later in life he moved to
New York and opened a meatpacking company. He was a goop
and caring employer and became
affectionately known as Uncle Sam.
Sam Wilson sold meat to the army,
and he wrote the letters US on the
crates. This meant 'United States',
but this abbreviation was not yet
common. One day a company worker
was asked what the letters US stood
for. He wasn't sure, and wrongly said that perhaps the
letters stood for his employer, Uncle Sam. Nevertheless,
the mistake continued. Soon soldiers started referring
to all military goods as coming from Uncle Sam. They
even saw themselves as Uncle Sam's men. ☐

wasting their money on drinking and gambling.

Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,
Put crêpe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.
He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.
The stars are not wanted now; put out every one;
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.
For nothing now can ever come to any good.

CHILDHOOD
- the best time of your Life
1 Some people say that childhood is the best time
of your life. However, being a child has both
advantages and disadvantages.
2
3
On the plus side, you have very few responsibilities.
For example, you don't have to go to work, pay bills,
or do the shopping, cooking, or cleaning. This means
you have plenty of free time to do whatever you
want - watch TV; play on the computer; go out with
friends; play sports, or pursue other hobbies. On top
of that, public transport, cinema, and sports centres
cost much less for children. All in all, being a child
is an exciting, action-packed time in life.
However, for every plus there is a minus. For one
thing, you have to spend all day, Monday to Friday,
at school. Studying usually means you have to do
homework, and you have to take exams. What is
more, you may have a lot of free time, but you are
rarely allowed to do whatever you want. You usually
have to ask your parents if you can do things, from
going shopping in town to staying out late or going
to a party. Last of all, although there are often
cheaper prices for children, things are still expensive
- and parents are not always generous with pocket
money. There's never enough to do everything you
want. The reality is that sometimes there's not
enough to do anything at all!
4
2 There are four paragraphs. What is the purpose of each one?
3 Match the pros with the cons.
Pros
1 don't have to go to work
2 can go out to parties with friends
3 don't have to cook and clean
4 costs less to do things
Cons
To sum up, although some people see childhood as
the best time in life, I think that children have no real
choice, independence, or money. Nevertheless, it is
true that choice, money, and independence all bring
responsibilities and restrictions - which increase with
age.

My favourite roomhe room in our house (1) is our kitchen. Perhaps the T
kitchen is the most important room in many houses, but it is
particularly so in our house because it's not only (2)
but it's also the place (3)
I have so many happy memories of times spent there: ordinary
daily events such as making breakfast on dark, cold winter
mornings for children (4) , before sending them off to
school; or special occasions such as homecomings or cooking
Christmas dinner. Whenever we have a party, people gravitate with
their drinks to the kitchen. It always ends up the fullest and
noisiest room in the house.
So what does this special room look like? It's quite big, but not
huge. It's big enough to have a good-sized rectangular table in the
centre, (5) . There is a large window above the sink, looking

Australia; the menu from a take-away Chinese restaurant; an

A HOLIDAY HORROR STORY
AFTER CHRISTMAS two years ago Jack and Liza decided to go away for New Year.
They didn't want to stay in a hotel with crowds of people and they were delighted
when they saw an advertisement in The Sunday Times for a holiday flat in a village
near Oxford. It was no ordinary flat. It was on the top floor of an old Elizabethan
mansion. They booked it, and on New Year's Eve they set off in the car. It was
raining and freezing cold, they were happy and excited.
They had been driving for three hours when they saw the house in the distancе.
It looked magnificent with tall chimneys and a long, wide drive. They drove up to
the house, went up the steps to the huge front door and knocked. Nothing happened.
They knocked again. The door opened and a small, wild-looking old lady stood there.

Of all my relatives, I like my Aunt Emily the best. She's
my mother's youngest sister. She has never married and
she lives all alone in a small village near Bath. She's in
her late fifties, but she's still quite young in spirit. She
has a fair complexion, curly grey hair, and deep blue
eyes. She has a kind face, and when you meet her, the
first thing you notice about her is her warm,friendly
smile. Her face is a little lined now, but I think she is
still rather attractive. She is the kind of person you can
always go to if you have a problem.
Aunt Emily likes reading and gardening, and she likes
to take her dog, Buster, for long walks in the park.
She's a very active person. Either she's making something
or mending something or doing something to help
others. She does the shopping for some of the old people
in the village. She's extremely generous, but not very
tolerant of people who don't agree with her. I hope that
I am as contented as she is when I am her age.

Dear Mr and Mrs Kendall
I am home now since two weeks, but I have to start work immediately, so this is
the first time is possible for me to write. How are you all? Are you busy as usual?
Does Tim still work hard for his exam next month? I am miss you a lot and also all
my friends from Dublin. Yesterday I've received a letter from my Spain friend,
Martina, and she told me about some of the other people I met. She say that Atsuko
and Yuki will write me from Japan. I am lucky because I made so many good friend
during I was in Ireland. It was really interesting for me to meet people from so many
different countries. I think that we not only improved our English (I hope this!) but
we also knew people from all over the world and this is important.
My family are fine. They had a good summer holiday by the lake. We are all very
exciting because my brother will get married just before Christmas and we like very
much his girlfriend. They have looked for a flat near the city centre but it is no easy
to find one. If they won't find one soon, they will have to stay here with us.
Please can you check something for me? I can't find my red scarf. I think maybe
I have forgotten it in the cuboard in my bedroom.
Please write soon. My family send best wishes to you all. I hope I can come back
next year. Stay with you was a very wonderful experience for me. Thank you for all
things and excuse my mistakes. I already forget much words.
Yours faithfully,
Kati

Sport and leisure
I'm 85 years old, but I've always been interested
in keeping fit. Recently, I started doing aerobics. I
go once a week - on - erm - a Thursday
morning to the local old people's day centre. It's
really nice there.They run a special aerobics class
for us. Erm - first thing we do is exercise... for
about three quarters of an hour. We go through
all the exercises to music. There are between four
and eight of us depending on the weather, really.
We just wear loose-fitting clothes and
comfortable shoes or trainers and, erm - apart
from the music, and Julianne, our lovely
instructor, we don't need anything else! I'm quite
good at it now. I can do most of the exercises,
although there are one or two that are a bit
energetic for me at my age - erm - I'm one of
the oldest- erm - some of the others are just
babies of about sixty! Afterwards we all go for a
cup of tea and a piece of cake in the coffee bar.
It's a really nice morning.
Jenny
I didn't start skiing until my mid 40s. Now I go
once or twice a year for two weeks, usually in
early spring. I live in London, so I go to ski
resorts in Europe - in France, Italy, or Austria. At
first it was really difficult, starting in my 40s. I
spent most of my time on my bottom! But I was
determined to learn so I took some classes. My
husband thought I was mad - but my children
said 'You go for it Mum!' so I did and now my
husband's taken up skiing, too. I have my own
skis, ski poles, and boots and stuff -that I take
with me, and of course all the latest clothes - it's
important to be fashionable on the ski slopes,
you know. I have a lovely ski suit - I like to look
good. Now my instructor says I'm a very good
skier and in fact I even give lessons to friends -
and my husband! If you've never been skiing,
you should try it. Hey, I could give you your first
lesson!
Thomas
I absolutely love football. I'm crazy about it. It's
the best! I love watching it but I 'specially enjoy
playing it. I am nine years old and I play for the
local team at my school's football pitch. I play
matches twice a week - on Friday evenings after
school and on Sunday mornings. And we also
have football coaching on Tuesday evenings
when we just practise all our football skills. It's
brilliant! Er - we all have a special kit - a football
shirt with a number on the back - er - I'm
number 7, it's my lucky number! And we wear
shorts, socks and stuff, all in matching colours
and of course our football boots - oh- and we
also have to wear shin pads for protection, you
know. We have a team tracksuit, too -but we
only wear this before and after matches and for
training. Erm - my mum always comes to
support us - even when it's raining. Mmm - my
team isn't very good, in fact, we nearly always
lose - but we don't care! Er - our football coach,
Martin, says winning doesn't matter - it's taking
part that counts - mmm - maybe he's right, but

fantastic when we win! Yeah.

The Tale of Gluskap and the Baby
Gluskap the warrior was very pleased with
himself because he had fought and won so many
battles. He boasted to a woman friend: 'Nobody
can beat me!
'Really?' said the woman. 'I know someone who
can beat you. His name is Wasis. Gluskap had
never heard of Wasis. He immediately wanted to
meet him and fight him. So he was taken to the
woman's village. The woman pointed to a baby
who was sitting and sucking a piece of sugar on
the floor of a teepee.
'There, she said. "That is Wasis. He is little but he
is very strong.' Gluskap laughed and went up to
the baby. 'I am Gluskap. Fight me!'he shouted.
Little Wasis looked at him for a moment, then he
opened his mouth. 'Waaah! Waaah!' he
screamed. Gluskap had never heard such a
terrible noise. He danced a war dance and sang
some war songs. Wasis screamed louder. 'Waaah!
Waaah! Waaah!' Gluskap covered his ears and
ran out of the teepee. After he had runafew

W Well, Roy and I were at the beach near the
hotel and we were swimming in the sea - it
was our first day - and this huge wave came
along and knocked my sunglasses into the
water. I...
N Why were you swimming in your sunglasses?
W Oh, I don't know. I'd just left them on top of
my head. I'd forgotten they were there.
Anyway, they were gone. I couldn't find them
anywhere. I was really upset. You know Roy
had given me those sunglasses for my
birthday and they were really expensive.
N I remember - nearly £100.
W Yeah. Anyway, I had to have sunglasses, so I
bought a new pair - just a cheap pair this
time. The next day I was lying on the beach,
sunbathing. Then, suddenly another huge
wave
N You didn't lose another pair of sunglasses?
W No, no. You'll never believe this - there was
another huge wave. It completely covered me.
I was so wet and...
N Are you sure this was a good holiday?

on the sand, right next to me, were my
expensive sunglasses. The ones I had lost the
day before! I couldn't believe my eyes!

M Dracula? You're kidding!
S No- no, I'm not. I know everybody's heard of
Dracula and seen Dracula films, but I bet not

the better!

better horror movie. You feel really sorry for

Dracula is more scary... with huge teeth that
he sinks into the necks of beautiful women.

T4.9 Come round to my place!
Sumie
My name is Sumie. I come from Nagano, Japan.
In my country, we usually invite guests home at
the weekend for dinner, at about 7 o'clock in the
evening. Before they come, we must tidy the
front garden and clean the entrance hall. Then
we must spray it all with water to show that we
welcome our guests with cleanliness. The guests
usually bring a gift, and when they give you the
gift they say, I'm sorry this is such a small gift,
but in fact they have chosen it very carefully.
When the meal is ready the hostess says, We
have nothing special for you today, but you are
welcome to come this way'. You can see that in
Japan you should try to be modest and you
should not show off too much. If you don't
understand our culture, you may think this is
very strange.When we have foreign guests, we
try to serve traditional Japanese meals like sushi,
tempura, or sukiyaki, but when we have Japanese
guests, we serve all kinds of food such as
spaghetti, Chinese food, or steaks.
When guests leave, the host and hostess see them
out of the house and wait until their car turns
the corner of the street; they wait until they can't
see them any more.
Kate
My name is Kate and I'm from Bristol in
England. We like to have people over for lunch
and they usually get here around noon. We often
have people over to eat, but sometimes when we
invite a lot of people over, for a family gathering
for example, we have what's called a potluck
lunch'.
A potluck is an informal occasion, so people
dress casually. If the weather is nice we'll have it
outside in the garden. What makes it fun is that
everyone who comes has to bring a dish of food.
They're given a choice: starter, main course, salad
or vegetable, or dessert. As the host, I'll know
how many of each kind of dish the guests will
bring, but not exactly what the foods will be.
That's why it's called 'potluck' - it's a surprise,
having a dinner party and not knowing what
you're going to feed the guests! All I have to do is
make one dish myself and get cups, glasses, and
knives and forks together, and supply the drinks.
As the guests arrive, they put their dish on the
table, and people help themselves. Some guests
might bring a bottle of wine or flowers as a gift
but I don't expect anything. It's a fun, relaxed
way of getting together with friends or family.
Lucas
My name is Lucas and I'm from Porto Alegre
which is in the southern part of Brazil. We like to
invite our friends over at weekends, on a Friday
or a Saturday night for a 'Churrasco', or Brazilian
barbecue. These are very popular in this part of
Brazil.
People come about 8.00 in the evening and stay
to midnight or even later - sometimes until 2.00
in the morning, whenever people start getting
sleepy. People stay a long time; there is no set
time for dinner to end. We'll sit around and play
cards or just talk. It's very informal. If people
124 Tapescripts 4.9-5.4
want to bring something, I'll tell them to bring
something for the meal like a bottle of wine or
something for dessert.
Ah, but what about the food? At a 'Churrascо,
we cook different kinds of meat on long metal
skewers over an open flame. We have all kinds of
meat: beef, pork, and maybe Brazilian sausage.
Sometimes chicken too. Then we cut off slices of
meat from the skewers to serve the guests. It's
really delicious. We usually have potato salad or
rice as side dishes. After the meal we drink coffee
or espresso.

T 5.6 A weather forecast
And here's the weather for some popular
destinations in Western Europe for the next
twenty-four hours.
A
B
Let's begin in the north. I'm afraid spring isn't
here yet! Another major frontal system will
move in from the Atlantic affecting Northern
Ireland and Scotland, before moving on to
Scandinavia. It'ss going to bring plenty of rain,
which could fall as snow on Scottish
mountains. So it will feel very chilly
everywhere. Temperatures around five or six
degrees at best in the rain but much lower in
snowy areas, where they will stay around
freezing all day, you'll be lucky to see two
degrees.
Moving south now, into England and Wales,
most of northern France, and across through
Belgium and Holland. Things look more
springlike here and it will be a lot brighter
than in recent weeks. Along Channel coasts
especially, there may be a little rain at first,
with temperatures reaching only eight
degrees. Inland, however, there will be more
sunshine than showers, with all areas
becoming warmer and drier as the day goes
on. Towards the end of the day temperatures
could be as high as 15 degrees in these
regions. The winds will be light, coming from
the south but it will feel very pleasant.
C If you're lucky enough to be going to
southern France or Spain you'll find the best
of today's weather. In the far south of Spain,
mainly clear skies, lots of sun with high
temperatures for the time of year up to 24
degrees, and everywhere else 18 or 19 degrees
with some cloud. But it's not all good news.
Strong winds along the southern French coast
could spoil your evening walk.
D Further east, across the Alps, from
Switzerland into northern Italy, there are the
remains of another weather system. There will
be stormy weather during the day with
thunder and lightning, bringing over two
inches of rain to some lowland areas and
heavy snow to the mountains. Strong winds
and rain will continue most of the day. The
winds will make it feel much cooler for the
time of year with temperatures struggling to
reach ten degrees. And watch out for early
morning fog.
So that's it, a quick tour of Western Europe - not
bad in central countries, warm and sunny in
Spain; cool, wet, and windy in parts of Italy, and
Switzerland - oh, and stay away from those
Scottish mountains unless you're wearingwarm
clothes.

S Our student from Seoul arrived on Monday.
N What's her name?
S Soon-hee.
N That's a pretty name! What's she like?
S She's really nice. I'm sure we'll get on well. We
seem to have a lot in common.
N How do you know that already? What does
she like doing?
S Well, she likes dancing, and so do I. And we
both like listening to the same kind of music.
N What does she look like?
S Oh, she's really pretty. She has big, brown eyes
and long, dark hair.
N Why don't we do something with Soon-hee
this weekend? What should we do? Get a
pizza? Go clubbing? What would she like
to do?
S I'll ask her tonight. She was a bit homesick at
first, so l'm pretty sure she'll want to go out
and make some friends.
N How is she now?
S Oh, she's OK. She called her parents and she
felt much better after she'd spoken to them.
N Oh, that's good. I can't wait to meet her.

the kind of person you can always go to with
a problem.
3 Not very well. He still has a temperature and a
bad cough.
4 Well, she's crazy about horses. I don't think
she has any other hobbies. Oh, she plays golf
sometimes.
5 It's not very nice at all. It's raining, it's cold,
and it's pretty miserable. What about where
you are?
6 Mmm... a little like you, as a matter of fact.
He's about the same height, tall with blond
hair, but your hair's longer and straighter than
his. Other than that, you two are quite similar.
7 It was great. Really relaxing. Lots of sunshine,
good food. We did almost nothing but sit by
the pool and read books for the whole two
weeks.
8 I like all kinds, but I suppose I like
biographies and detective stories best.
6.3 A thank-you letter
Dear Sandy and family,
I just wanted to say thank you for having me as
your guest in your beautiful home. I had a great
time. I really enjoyed meeting your friends. You
all made me feel so welcome. You know how
much I missed my family at first, but you were
so kind that I soon stopped feeling homesick. I
can't find the words to tell you how grateful I
am. I'd like to call you. What's a good time to
call?
You know that on my way home I stopped to
visit my aunt in Perth. It was so hot! It was over
35 degrees all the time but I absolutely loved it.
My aunt wanted me to stay longer, but I wanted
to see my parents and my brother, Sang-chul.
But she's invited me to go back and I'd love to do
that. I'm thinking of going next year.
Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing from
you very soon. Let me know if you ever want to
visit Seoul. My brother and I could take you to a
'norebang' (a singing room). It's a bit like
karaoke!
Love to you all,
Soon-hee
P.S. Do you like the picture of Sang-chul
and me?

B Well, he's tall, dark and handsome, but he's
not very polite. In fact, he's even ruder

A How was your lunch?
B Ugh! It was awful. The pizza was
disgusting. We were really starving, but we
still couldn't eat it!
A Mmm! These tomatoes are really delicious.
Did you grow them yourselves?
B Yes,we did. All our vegetables are homegrown.
5 A Did you have a good time in London?
B We had a great time. There's so much to
do. It's a really exciting city. And there are
so many people from all over the world. I
think it's nearly as cosmopolitan as New
York.
6.7 New York
I = Interviewer, J = Justin, C = Cinda
I How long have you been here in New York?
J Nearly three years.
And are you enjoying it?
I We love it.
C It's great.
I So what do you like best?
C Oh, the atmosphere, the mixture of all kinds
of people. The speed of everything - it's
exciting.
J I love the architecture, it's so different from
London. Walking the streets and looking up
at all those skyscrapers.
I And what about the people?
C Well, New Yorkers have a reputation for being
rude and unfriendly, but I don't think that's
true. People are always in a hurry, but they're
not unfriendly.
J What I love is the - the great mixture of
nationalities and cultures. It's got to be the
most cosmopolitan city in the world.
I More than London?
J Hmm... well, I think so, but they're both
very mixed.
C Life here seems much faster than in London.
Everyone's in such a rush. Everything's done
for speed. For example, I- I don't think
people cook at home much - everyone seems
to eat out or get food delivered because it's
quicker and easier.
I Have you made many friends here?
I've made friends at work mostly. But it's - it's
difficult to make friends outside of work -
people are so busy. But mostly I find people
pretty friendly.
C Except the taxi drivers! Some of the rudest
people I've ever met are New York taxi
drivers!
J And some of the worst drivers. Every time I
sit in a taxi I say a prayer. They drive so fast
and suddenly they change lanes. And worst of
all they don't seem to know where anything is.
C Yeah-you spend the entire journey giving
directions. Anyway, I like using the subway.
It's cheap.
J Yeah, and easy to use and it seems safe to me.
We walk a lot as well. It's a lot safer now than

I
it was ten years ago. It's still not very clean but
it's getting better.
Do you have a car?
J No. No, we don't. Not many of our friends do,
actually. You don't really need one.
Π
C I'd hate to drive in the city, I'd be terrified.
Anyway, you can get everything delivered to
your door - not just food.
Don't you go shopping?
J Oh yeah, of course we do. Not all of us can
afford to shop on 5th Avenue, you know, but
it's - it's fun to look.
C Actually, the shops - sorry, the stores - are
great. Always open - well nearly always - til
9.00 or 10.00 at night.
J People work much later here. I wasn't
expecting to work such long hours! And the
holidays - sorry, vacation time - and the - the
public holidays they're, they're much shorter.
I only get ten days a year. It's difficult for
people like us with families in other countries.
It's difficult to find time to visit them.
Π But generally you're happy?
J Fantastic!
C It's an amazing place, but in a few years I
think I'll be exhausted and ready for a quieter
life!
T 6.8 London
I = Interviewer, A = Alan
I Alan, how long have you lived in London?
A Fifteen years
I And do you like it here?
A Sure I like it - but London is one of those
cities that you love and hate at the same time.
I So first - what do you hate?
A Oh the usual big city things - the crowds, the
dirt, the traffic, and of course the
Underground - it's so expensive compared
with the subway in New York.
I And what do you like?
A Oh, a lot: fantastic theatres - I'm an actor so
that's important for me - great art galleries,
museums, I love the Natural History
Museum. Concerts, wonderful orchestras. The
best of everything comes to London.
I And what's best for you?
A
T
A
I
For me? Oh, I just love standing on Waterloo
Bridge and looking down the river at the
Houses of Parliament and now, of course
there's the London Eye - I think it's just
wonderful. And - I like travelling in the black
cabs. Taxi drivers here are great, so friendly!
They tell you their life stories AND they
know every street in London - not like in
New York.
And what about the people? What do you
think of Londoners?
Ah well - generally speaking, I think that they
do live up to their reputation - they are
reserved. It takes a while to get to know
people. They won't tell you about themselves.
You say to an American 'How are you?' and
you get 'Oh man, I'm just great. I got the
promotion and I love working here in Dallas,
Denver, Detroit or Delaware etc. y' know. Ask
an Englishman 'How are you?' and you get 'Er
- fine, thank you.
So the stereotype's true?
A Yeah, they're - they're pretty reserved. They
don't like giving personal details, but they
complain a lot about life generally. They seem
much less positive about life - much more
I
A
I
A
cynical than Americans. They grumble about
transport and politicians and money, how
much things cost, their work...
So, we're a miserable lot then!
Not really. Leisure time - sorry - free time- is
really important to the British. I think for
many Americans, work is the most important
thing in their lives. Americans work much
longer hours. In Britain they get more
vacation time and time off...
... and still they grumble!
Yeah.
I You've been in London 15 years. Has it
changed in that time?
A Oh yeah a lot - especially the shops, they stay
open much longer now. They used to close
every Wednesday afternoon. People in the
States could never believe that. Oh and the
food!
I
A
I
Everyone says English food is terrible. Is it?
Well, when I first came it was terrible. It was
so hard to get good food. Nowadays it's not
hard at all. London has some great restaurants
- my favourite here is the Indian food, it's
fantastic. I think we have one of the best right
here on our street. Just the best!
You live in south London. Do you like it there?
A Very much. I love the mix of cultures and
nationalities in every street.
I How long do you think you'll stay here?
A Oh, I don't know. Maybe five more years.
Maybe forever!

P Well, I know you went to visit Uncle Keith in
Australia. And you've just come back from a

D Will you keep in touch with friends?
A Of course we will. When we get there, we'll
give you a call.
T
D And how will I contact you?
D
J
Well, as soon as we find a place to live, we'll
send you our address.
Hmmm, I can always email you.
Yes, email's brilliant for keeping in touch, but
you'll have to wait until we've set up our
computers.
A And David, I promise, you'll be our first guest
when we move into our new home.
D Excellent. I'll look forward to that!
T 8.3 D = David, S = Sue
D Bye, darling! Good luck with the interview!
S Thanks. I'll need it. I hope the trains are
running on time. If I'm late for the interview,
I'll be furious with myself!
D Just stay calm! Call me when you can.
S I will. I'll call you on my mobile as soon as I
get out of the interview.
D When will you know if you've got the job?
S They'll tell me in the next few days. If they
offer me the job, I'm going to accept it. You
know that, don't you?
D Of course. But we'll worry about that later.
S OK. Are you going to work now?
D Well, I'm going to take the children to schoo!
before I go to work.
S Don't forget to pick them up as soon as you
finish.
D Don't worry, I won't forget. You'd better get
going. If you don't hurry, you'll miss the train.
S OK.I'll see you this evening. Bye!

18.4 Winning the lottery
What would I do if I won £5 million? Well, I'd
make sure my family had enough money, and
my friends, and then I'd buy my own island in
the Caribbean. And I'd give loads of money to
charity.
2 Oh, that's easy! I'd give up my job and travel.
Anywhere. Everywhere. Oh but it wouldn't
change me. I'd still live in the same area
because I like it so much.
3 What would I do? I'd buy a nice house in the
country. I'd make it the best place I could.
And I'd have lots of land so I could have
peace and quiet!
